 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

```

       if(n<=1) return 1;
      int pre2=1;
      int pre1=1;
      int current =0;
       for(int i=2;i<=n;i++){
       current=pre1+pre2;
       pre2=pre1;
       pre1=current;
       }
    
       return current;
    }
